# Multi-Label-Plant-Disease-Prediction
Developed a Deep Learning Model to classify plant diseases in a multi label manner. The model tries to classify even those plant images which might have multiple conditions at the same time which is an edge case.
Assembled a multi label plant disease data set and trained it on multiple transfer learning models. The results from these models were compared to get the best fit.
Two models were developed for this purpose. One was based on Inception V3 and the other was based on Xception.
